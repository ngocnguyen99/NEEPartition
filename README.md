# Incorporating Water Dynamics into Ecosystem Carbon Flux Models
# Description
This project aims to capture ecosystem CO2 flux responses to long-term changes in water dynamics. It incorporates Soil Water Content (SWC) measurements into eddy-covariance carbon flux models using Michaelis-Menten equation, specifically via modifying the FLUXNET Nighttime Partitioning Method.
